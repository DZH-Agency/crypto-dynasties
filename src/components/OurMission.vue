          Our Mission & The First Community Event
        </h3>
        <div class="mission-text-box">
          <p>
            Our mission is to become the most popular and highest rewarding NFT community for holders in the metaverse
            and what better way to accomplish this task then to kick things of with getting the actual builders and
            founders of the CryptoDynasties’ blockchains to use our custom-made mascots as their social media avatars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter our first community event called <strong>“Capture The Flag”</strong>! On a Sunday, 1 week after the minting has
            commenced, we will vote on team leaders within each CryptoDynasty. After that, each team will choose their
            TOP 3 Most Valuable Targets (Flags) within their blockchain ecosystem. Once the Targets are chosen, our
            artist Nuxer will create custom mascots just for them. During the art creation process, each team is
            instructed to brainstorm and form an attack plan on how to win the attention of their Targets. Once each
            team has received their ammo (art), it’s showtime!
          </p>
          <p>
            Each time a team captures a flag, our community as a whole will benefit. We also want to hold weekly or
            bi-weekly metaverse ceremonies to celebrate our small wins throughout the journey! Who knows, maybe we’ll
            start giving out weekly awards for Most Valuable Players - the community will decide!
          </p>
          <p>
            Buying a CryptoDynasties’ NFT is not just about the art, but also the meaning we create throughout our
            shared metaverse journey. The life-long relationships we build and the hardships we overcome together. The
            experiences this project provides will be way more valuable than any number placed on the art piece itself.

          <p>
            Metaverse-compatible collectibles, wearables and game assets are items designed for use on compatible
            decentralised platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each platform has different compatibility rules and characteristics for their asset files which means we'll
            choose a certain platform each month depending on global metaverse and gaming ecosystem developments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our long term vision is to airdrop state-of-the-art limited edition items that holders can either sell or
            use to outdress & outperform their friends in digital worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the development of the project we will airdrop metaverse items based on how many CryptoDynasties NFTs
            they hold during the airdrop event.

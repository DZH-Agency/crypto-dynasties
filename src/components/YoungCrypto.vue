            Our story begins with the first CryptoDynasty to ever set foot on Earth - The Bitcoin Dynasty. Historical archives show that its first member was born on January 3rd, 2009. Since then a lot of dynasties have risen and fallen, leaving the most adaptable and powerful to lead the way from a $460 billion USD to $2.8 trillion USD global market cap just last year alone. Researchers studying the dynasties have said that only 11% of people within the United States are proven successors of any dynasty alive today, proving how early this chapter of Earth's history actually is.

                Because of the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies a strong community plays a vital part in the success of any CryptoDynasty. Inspired by NBA, NHL, NFL and NCAA team mascots whose job is to bring the team and the fans together, we saw an opportunity to introduce this fun element to the blockchain industry and create the world's first on-chain cryptocurrency mascots.

                Our goal was to create visually appealing characters that would enable cryptocurrency enthusiasts to root for and show commitment to their favorite projects by using their NFT's proudly as avatars across social media platforms. By doing so achieving two important objectives:<br>
                (1) bringing awareness to their favorite coin and the CryptoDynasties collection,<br>
                (2) <strong>helping both of their digital assets grow together.</strong>
